# Introduction
This analysis is being conducted to help design a stormwater structure to store 
(high conductivity) snow melt and release it at the optimal time to minimize 
the conductivity observed in the downstream receiving waters.  If this proves
feasible, it may provide a way to reduce the ecological impact of high 
conductivity events on the stream biota. To guide design decisions, we want to 
understand patterns of specific conductance in Long Creek in and around winter 
"high conductivity" events.

While we have looked at statistical approaches, we fall back on a predominately 
graphical approach to understanding what affects conductivity in Long Creek.

## Data Limitations
We downloaded weather data directly from an on-line NOAA archive.
Daily summary data on weather is readily available.  We have not found a 
convenient way to access historical hourly weather data.  As a result, **most** 
graphics are based on daily summary statistics.  The values we use 
for specific conductance and water depth are based on daily median.  Weather 
data are daily totals (for precipitation and snowfall) or minimums and maximums 
(for temperature).

# Import Libraries
We used several R "Packages" in preparing the analyses,  We show which ones
we used here, for transparency purposes. The most important packages are part of
the well-known "Tidyverse".  The Tidyverse is set of r packages that function
almost as extensions to base R. They are widely used for data manipulation, 
graphics development, and programming in R.

The `CBEPgraphics` Package is a small package built by CBEP staff that
facilitates making graphics with consistent design defaults.  It is not
strictly necessary for any of the following analyses.

```{r libraries, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(gridExtra)   # Facilitates assembling graphics from multiple plots

library(tidyverse)   # Used for data manipulation (dplyr) and graphics (ggplot2)
#library(rlang)       # Used to allow "tidy evaluation" in our graphics function

library(CBEPgraphics)   # Allows Consistent CBEP graphics design
load_cbep_fonts()       # Including the 'Montserrat' font family
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

```{r folder_refs, include = FALSE}
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

# Data Preparation
We omit most data preparation code, as of little interest to readers, and
simply summarize the steps and decisions made.

## Load Weather Data
Weather data was downloaded from a NOAA "Climate Data Online" API using a 
custom Python script.  The data included daily information on precipitation,
snowfall, and (minimum and maximum) air temperatures.
```{r load_weather_data, echo = FALSE}
fn <- "Portland_Jetport_2009-2019_long.csv"
weather_data <- read_csv(fn, 
                         col_types = cols(
                           date = col_character(),
                           datatype = col_character(),
                           value	= col_number(),
                           attributes = col_skip(),
                           station = col_skip())) %>%
  rename(sdate = date) %>%
  mutate(sdate = substr(sdate, 1,10)) %>%
  mutate(sdate = as.Date(sdate)) %>%
  pivot_wider(sdate, names_from = datatype, values_from = value) %>%
  select(sdate, AWND, PRCP, SNOW, SNWD, TMIN, TMAX, TAVG) %>%
  mutate(PRCP = PRCP / 10,
         TMAX = TMAX/10,
         TMIN = TMIN / 10) %>%
  mutate(SNOW = if_else(SNOW < 0 , NA_real_, SNOW)) %>%
  mutate(pPRCP = dplyr::lag(PRCP),
         pSNOW = dplyr::lag(SNOW)) %>%
  relocate(pSNOW, .after = SNOW) %>%
  relocate(pPRCP, .after = PRCP) 

```

## Load Water Depth Data
We developed daily summaries of the LCWMD data for our "State of Casco Bay" data 
analysis.  Here we load only the daily medians for water depth.
```{r load_data, echo = FALSE}
fn <- "Daily_data.csv"

depth_data <- read_csv(fn, progress=FALSE, 
                          col_types = cols(
                            pH_Mean = col_number(),
                            pH_Median = col_number(),
                            pH_Min = col_number(),
                            pH_Max = col_number(),
                            pH_SD = col_number(),
                            pH_Iqr = col_number() )) %>%
  select(-ends_with('Min'), -ends_with('Max'), -ends_with('Mean'),
         -ends_with('Iqr'), -ends_with('SD'), -ends_with('_n')) %>%
  filter(Site %in% c('S01', 'S03', 'S05', 'S07')) %>%
  select(Site, sdate, D_Median)
```

We have some screwy summer water levels from May or June of 2015 at site S05. 
We filter out any observation over 3 meters.  Since w eare interested in winter 
conditions, this does not matter much.
```{r}
ggplot(depth_data, aes(sdate, D_Median, color = Site)) + geom_point()
```

```{r} 
depth_data <- depth_data %>%
  mutate(D_Median = if_else(D_Median > 3, NA_real_, D_Median)) %>%
  pivot_wider(sdate, names_from = Site, values_from = D_Median) %>%
  filter(if_all(c('S01', 'S03', 'S05', 'S07'),  ~ ! is.na(.)))
```

# Combine Daily and Weather Data
We merged the two source datasets by date.
```{r combine_data, echo = FALSE}
the_data <- weather_data %>%
  left_join(depth_data, by = 'sdate') %>%

  mutate(Month = as.numeric(format(sdate, format = '%m'))) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb)) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(format(sdate, format = '%Y'))) %>%
  mutate(Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%
  mutate(DOY = as.numeric(format(sdate, format = '%j'))) %>%

  relocate(Year, Yearf, Month, DOY, .after = sdate)

#head(depth_data)
```


# Winter Months
We restrict our attention to February, and March.  (Preliminary review
showed that there are few high conductivity events in the December data.  We
have too little January data to make much difference.).
```{r limit_to_winter_data}
winter_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(Month %in% month.abb[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 12)]) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = c('Dec', 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr')))
  
```

# Exploratory Graphic
We take a quick look at the winter data
```{r all_plots_graphic, echo = FALSE}
plt1 <- ggplot(winter_data, aes(sdate, PRCP)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Precipitation (mm)') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)

plt2<- ggplot(winter_data, aes(sdate, SNOW /10)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Snow (cm)') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)

plt <- grid.arrange(plt1, plt2,  nrow = 2, heights = c(1,1))
```
That's not very helpful, except that is showns many precip events that don't
line up with snow events.


# "Big Rain"
We really want to identify "rain events", say over 10 mm = 1 cm precipitation 
with snow under five times the precip.  As a rule of thumb, fresh snow is about 
ten times the depth of equivalent rain, so this suggests most of the precip fell 
as rain during those events.

```{r}
winter_data <- winter_data %>%
  mutate(bigrain = PRCP > 8 & SNOW < 5*PRCP,
         snowevent = SNOW > 0)
  
```


```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
plt3 <- ggplot(winter_data, aes(DOY, PRCP, fill = bigrain)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Precipitation (mm)') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~Year)


plt4 <- ggplot(winter_data, aes(DOY, SNOW/10, fill = bigrain)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Snow (cm)') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~Year)

plt <- grid.arrange(plt3, plt4,  nrow = 2, heights = c(1,1))
```

With that in hand, we can make a frequency table.
```{r}
(freq_table <- xtabs(~Year + Month, data = winter_data, subset = bigrain))
```

```{r}
mn <- apply(freq_table, 2, mean)
stnd_dev <- apply(freq_table, 2, sd)
tbl <- cbind(round(mn,1), round(stnd_dev,3))
colnames(tbl) <- c('Mean', 'Std. Dev.')
tbl
```

# Snow Events

```{r}
freq_table <- xtabs(~Year + Month, data = winter_data, subset = snowevent)
mn <- apply(freq_table, 2, mean)
stnd_dev <- apply(freq_table, 2, sd)
tbl <- cbind(round(mn,1), round(stnd_dev,3))
colnames(tbl) <- c('Mean', 'Std. Dev.')
tbl
```
