Supplementary analysis of LCWMD chloride/conductivity data from State of Casco Bay

The Long Creek Watershed Management District (LCWMD) provides water quality and stormwater 
management services to about 130 landowners and businesses in the Long Creek Watershed, 
in South Portland, Maine.  As part of their services, they run one of the most
thorough urban stream water quality monitoring programs in the U.S. northeast. An
important lesson from the Long Creek monitoring program has been that elevated 
levels of chloride in the stream, derived from use of salt for deicing roads, 
parking areas and paths during the winter, has significant negative effects on the
Creek.  

In Long Creek, conductivity is highly correlated with measured chloride
concentrations.  Automated data collection systems gather data on conductivity
on an hourly basis, generating a rich data set for understanding relationships
between weather and observed conductivity (and hence chlorides) in the stream.

Maine DOT is looking for creative solutions for addressing the problem of chlorides
in urban waters, and so turned to data from Long Creek to provide insight into
the problem.  The idea is that if the timing of discharges of high chloride runoff
could be controlled so that salty water is realeased when streamflow is high, the
impact ont he organisms living in the stream could be minimized.

This analysis was conducted to help design a possible stormwater structure to store 
(high conductivity) snow melt and release it at the optimal time to minimize the 
conductivity observed in the downstream receiving waters. While we have looked at 
statistical approaches, we fell back on a predominately graphical approach to 
understanding what affects conductivity in Long Creek.
