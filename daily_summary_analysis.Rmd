# Introduction
This analysis is being conducted to help design a stormwater structure to store 
(high conductivity) snow melt and release it at the optimal time to minimize 
the conductivity observed in the downstream receiving waters.  If this proves
feasible, it may provide a way to reduce the ecological impact of high 
conductivity events on the stream biota. To guide design decisions, we want to 
understand patterns of specific conductance in Long Creek in and around winter 
"high conductivity" events.

While we have looked at statistical approaches, we fall back on a predominately 
graphical approach to understanding what affects conductivity in Long Creek.

## Data Limitations
This analysis is based on the data selected data from the Long Creek Watershed
Management District (LCWMD).  In particular, it is based on data shared with the
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership (CBEP) in preparation for our 2020 "State of Casco
Bay" report.  Those data do not include discharge data, although it is my
understanding that discharge data is available.  We use water depth as a 
weak surrogate for discharge here, but mass-balance calculations (estimating
mass of chloride flowing past monitoring locations per unit time) are not 
possible with these data alone.

In addition, we downloaded weather data directly from an on-line NOAA archive.
Daily summary data on weather is readily available.  We have not found a 
convenient way to access historical hourly weather data.  As a result, **most** 
graphics are based on daily summary statistics.  The values we use 
for specific conductance and water depth are based on daily median.  Weather 
data are daily totals (for precipitation and snowfall) or minimums and maximums 
(for temperature).

# Import Libraries
We used several R "Packages" in preparing these analyses,  We show which ones
we used here, for transparency purposes. The most important packages are part of
the well-known "Tidyverse".  The Tidyverse is set of r packages that function
almost as extensions to base R. They are widely used for data manipulation, 
graphics development, and programming in R.

The `CBEPgraphics` Package is a small package built by CBEP staff that
facilitates making graphics with consistent design defaults.  It is not
strictly necessary for any of the following analyses.

```{r libraries, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(gridExtra)   # Facilitates assembling graphics from multiple plots

library(tidyverse)   # Used for data manipulation (dplyr) and graphics (ggplot2)
library(rlang)       # Used to allow "tidy evaluation" in our graphics function

library(CBEPgraphics)   # Allows Consistent CBEP graphics design
load_cbep_fonts()       # Including the 'Montserrat' font family
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

```{r folder_refs, include = FALSE}
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

# Data Preparation
We omit most data preparation code, as of littler interest to readers.  We
include
## Load Weather Data
Weather data was downloaded from a NOAA "Climate Data Online" API using a 
custom Python script.  The data included daily information on precipitation,
snowfall, and (minimum and maximum) air temperatures.
```{r load_weather_data, echo = FALSE}
fn <- "Portland_Jetport_2009-2019_long.csv"
weather_data <- read_csv(fn, 
                         col_types = cols(
                           date = col_character(),
                           datatype = col_character(),
                           value	= col_number(),
                           attributes = col_skip(),
                           station = col_skip())) %>%
  rename(sdate = date) %>%
  mutate(sdate = substr(sdate, 1,10)) %>%
  mutate(sdate = as.Date(sdate)) %>%
  pivot_wider(sdate, names_from = datatype, values_from = value) %>%
  select(sdate, AWND, PRCP, SNOW, SNWD, TMIN, TMAX, TAVG) %>%
  mutate(PRCP = PRCP / 10,
         TMAX = TMAX/10,
         TMIN = TMIN / 10) %>%
  mutate(SNOW = if_else(SNOW < 0 , NA_real_, SNOW)) %>%
  mutate(pPRCP = dplyr::lag(PRCP),
         pSNOW = dplyr::lag(SNOW)) %>%
  relocate(pSNOW, .after = SNOW) %>%
  relocate(pPRCP, .after = PRCP) 

```

## Load Daily Data
We developed daily summaries of the LCWMD datafor our "State of Casco Bay data 
analysis.  Here we loaded only the daily medians for conductivity, water depth, 
and (estimated) chloride concentrations.in daily summaries and retain only the 
median values.
```{r load_data, echo = FALSE}
fn <- "Daily_Data.csv"

daily_data <- read_csv(fn, progress=FALSE, 
                          col_types = cols(
                            pH_Mean = col_number(),
                            pH_Median = col_number(),
                            pH_Min = col_number(),
                            pH_Max = col_number(),
                            pH_SD = col_number(),
                            pH_Iqr = col_number() )) %>%
  select(-ends_with('Min'), -ends_with('Max'), -ends_with('Mean'),
         -ends_with('Iqr'), -ends_with('SD'), -ends_with('_n')) %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site)) %>%
  arrange(Site, sdate) %>%
  
  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb)) %>%
  mutate(Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%
  mutate(DOY = as.numeric(format(sdate, format = '%j'))) %>%
  relocate(Year, Yearf, Month, DOY, .after = sdate)
```

# Combine Daily and Weather Data
We merged the two source datasets by date.
```{r combine_data, echo = FALSE}
daily_data <- daily_data %>%
  left_join(weather_data, by = 'sdate') %>%
  select(-contains('attr')) %>%
  select(-Precip, -PPrecip, -MaxT)
#head(daily_data)
```

## Data Corrections
During our "State of Casco BAy data review, we noted several inconsistencies in 
the LCWMD data.  her we walk through the corrections we chose to maketo the data as originally provided to us by LCWMD.

(Most of these corrections have no effect on our analyses, since they 
relate to data from the summer months; we include them here for completeness.)  

## Anomolous Depth Values
Several depth observations in the record are impossible or highly unlikely. In
particular, several observations show daily median water depths over 15 meters.
And those observations were recorded in May or June, at site S05, with no
associated record of significant precipitation, and no elevated depths at other
sites on the stream.

A few more observations show daily median depths over 4 meters, which also
looks unlikely in a stream of this size.  All these events also occurred in 
May or June of 2015 at site S05. Some sort of malfunction of the pressure 
transducer appears likely.

We can trace these observations back to the raw QA/QC'd pressure and sonde data 
submitted to LCWMD by GZA, so they are not an artifact of data preparation.

We removed extreme values (anything over 4 meters).  The other daily medians 
in May and June of 2015 appear reasonable, and we leave them in place, although
given possible instability of the pressure sensors, it could make sense to 
remove them all.

```{r fix_depths, include = FALSE}
daily_data <- daily_data %>%
  mutate(D_Median = if_else(D_Median > 4, NA_real_, D_Median))
```

### Single S06B Chloride Observation from 2017
The data includes just a single chloride observation from site S06B from any
year other than 2013.  While we do not know if the data point is legitimate or
not, it has very high leverage in statistical models, and we suspect a
transcription error of some sort. We removed related Conductivity and Chloride
values from the data. Since we chose not to look at Site S06B because of a lack
of winter data, this does not affect our analyses.


```{r fix_conduct, include = FALSE}
daily_data <- daily_data %>%
  mutate(Chl_Median = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA_real_, Chl_Median),
         SpCond_Median = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA_real_, SpCond_Median))
```

### Site S03, End of 2016
We noted some extreme dissolved oxygen data at the end of 2016.  Values were
both extreme and highly variable.  We concluded that the data was suspect, 
perhaps because of damage to, burying of the sensors. We decided to remove 
chloride and oxygen observations after October 15th that year.

```{r fix_s03, include = FALSE}
daily_data <- daily_data %>% 
  mutate(Chl_Median = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA_real_, Chl_Median),
         SpCond_Median = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA_real_, SpCond_Median),
         DO_Median = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA_real_, DO_Median),
         PctSat_Median = if_else(Year == 2016 & Site == 'S03' & DOY > 288,
                              NA_real_, PctSat_Median))
```

# Data Review
## Limited Data from Winter Months
We have  limited data from most winter months. We have January data 
from only one year, February data from only three, and December data from 
four.

```{r month_by_year_crosstab}
xtabs(~ Yearf + Month, data = daily_data)
```

We restrict our attention to February, and March.  (Preliminary review
showed that there are few high conductivity events in the December data.  We
have too little January data to make much difference.).
```{r limit_to_winter_data}
winter_data <- daily_data %>%
  filter(Month %in% month.abb[c(2,3)]) %>%   
  filter(! is.na(SpCond_Median))
```

## Uneven Winter Sampling By Site
```{r winter_xtab, echo = FALSE}
cat('Number of Days with Data by Site and Year\n')
xtabs(~ Site + Year, data = winter_data)
```
# Drop Data from Sites with Little Winter Data
We retain data from four sites:

* Site S07 is at the bottom of Blanchard Brook.  
* Site S05 is mid-watershed, upstream of the Turnpike.  
* S03 is just above the confluence of the the North Branch with the Main Stem.  
* S01 is near the bottom of the South Branch.

```{r limit_winter_data_by_site}
winter_data <- winter_data %>%
  filter(Site != 'S06B' & Site != 'S17')
```

# Exploratory Graphic
We take a quick look at all the winter data
```{r all_plots_graphic, echo = FALSE}
plt <- ggplot(winter_data, aes(DOY, SpCond_Median, color = Yearf)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  facet_wrap(~Site) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  xlab('Day of Year') +
  ylab('Median Daily Specific Conductance') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)
plt
```
We see a two (or perhaps three) clear conductivity spikes, in 2011 and 2017,
that show up at all sites (when we have data). We will focus on these events,
each of which is associated with a major winter storm.  We choose not to examine 
several other conductivity spikes, because they are smaller, or less consistent
across sites.  For example, another sizeable spike appears (around DOY == 78) 
in 2013, but only at Site S01.

```{r make_subsets, include = FALSE}
s07_data <- winter_data %>%
  filter(Site == 'S07') %>%
  arrange(sdate)

s05_data<- winter_data %>%
  filter(Site == 'S05') %>%
  arrange(sdate)

s03_data<- winter_data %>%
  filter(Site == 'S03') %>%
  arrange(sdate)

s01_data<- winter_data %>%
  filter(Site == 'S01') %>%
  arrange(sdate)
```

# Event-based Graphics
We designed a graphic that shows specific conductance at the top of a 
multi-panel layout, with likely environmental drivers shown below. We wrote a
function to produce the graphic based on selected data, so we could focus
on what is going on at specific sites around specific high conductivity events.
```{r make_graph_fxn, include = FALSE}

# 2011 Conductivity Peak
## 2011 Storm at Site S07
```{r plot_site_S07_2011, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
focus_data <- s07_data %>%
  filter(Year == 2011 & DOY < 70) %>%
  select(sdate, DOY, SpCond_Median, D_Median, PRCP, SNOW, TMIN, TMAX) %>%
  rename(SpCond = SpCond_Median,
         Depth = D_Median)


plt <- time_plot(focus_data, sdate, SpCond, TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, SNOW, Depth,
                      .title = '2011 Storm at Site S7') 
ggsave('figures/site_s07_2011.pdf', plot = plt,
       device = cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 6)

```

Conductivity starts out high, but climbs further for several days **after** a
major winter storm that dumped more than 9 inches of snow at the Jetport. What
appears to be a warmer winter storm occurs on the 27th and 28th.  The storm
appears to  shift from mostly snow on 2/27 to mostly rain on 2/28.  Water levels
in Blanchette Brook climb on the 29th, and conductivity in the stream drops
quickly for a few days, but then levels off again.  A major rainstorm in early 
March drops more than 2 inches of rain, which leads to another increase in water 
depth, and a rapid drop in conductivity.

## 2011 Storm at Site S03
Depth data is unavailable from Site S03 for the period of these storms.
```{r plot_site_S03_2011, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
focus_data <- s03_data %>%
  filter(Year == 2011 & DOY < 70) %>%
  select(sdate, DOY, SpCond_Median, D_Median, PRCP, SNOW, TMIN, TMAX) %>%
  rename(SpCond = SpCond_Median,
         Depth = D_Median)

plt <- time_plot(focus_data, sdate, SpCond, TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, SNOW, Depth,
                      .title = '2011 Storm at Site SO3') 
ggsave('figures/site_s03_2011.pdf', plot = plt, device = cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 6)
```
While specific conductance at S03 is nearly double what we saw at S07, the
temporal pattern is similar. Without local depth data, we can not interpret
these data with  much authority, but it is likely that similar processes are at
work.

## 2011 Storm at Site S01
Depth data is unavailable from Site S03 for the period of these storms.
```{r plot_site_S01_2011, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
focus_data <- s01_data %>%
  filter(Year == 2011 & DOY < 70) %>%
  select(sdate, DOY, SpCond_Median, D_Median, PRCP, SNOW, TMIN, TMAX) %>%
  rename(SpCond = SpCond_Median,
         Depth = D_Median)

plt <- time_plot(focus_data, sdate, SpCond, TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, SNOW, Depth,
                      .title = '2011 Storm at Site SO1') 
ggsave('figures/site_s01_2011.pdf', plot = plt, 
       device = cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 6)
```

Again, we lack water depth data from this site, but the overall pattern is 
similar.

# 2017 Conductivity Peak
## 2017 Storms at Site S07
```{r plot_site_S07_2017, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
focus_data <- s07_data %>%
  filter(Year == 2017 & DOY> 60 & DOY < 100) %>%
  select(sdate, DOY, SpCond_Median, D_Median, PRCP, SNOW, TMIN, TMAX) %>%
  rename(SpCond = SpCond_Median,
         Depth = D_Median)

plt <- time_plot(focus_data, sdate, SpCond, TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, SNOW, Depth,
                      .title = '2011 Storms at Site S7') 

ggsave('figures/site_s07_2017.pdf', plot = plt, device = cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 6)
```

The record starts with specific conductance rising rapidly, while water depth in
Blanchette Brook is dropping, perhaps following a relatively small rain event a
few days prior to the beginning of the record shown here. A light rain event
that persisted for several days under relatively warm conditions causes stream 
flow to jump, and conductivity to fall.  Colder weather,a minor snowfall on 3/10
and a large snow event on 3/14 preceded a rapid climb in conductivity.
Conductivity stayed relatively high for over a week. A second spike in
conductivity follows a (very) minor snow event around 03/24. A large (about 3/4
inch) rain event on 3/27 leads to a jump in water depth in the stream, and
a rapid decline in conductivity.

## 2017 Storms at Site S05
```{r plot_site_S05_2017, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
focus_data <- s05_data %>%
  filter(Year == 2017 & DOY> 60 & DOY < 100) %>%
  select(sdate, DOY, SpCond_Median, D_Median, PRCP, SNOW, TMIN, TMAX) %>%
  rename(SpCond = SpCond_Median,
         Depth = D_Median)

plt <- time_plot(focus_data, sdate, SpCond, TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, SNOW, Depth,
                      .title = '2017 Storms at Site SO5') 
ggsave('figures/site_s05_2017.pdf', plot = plt,
       device = cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 6)
```

The overall pattern at site S05 looks similar to what we observed at Site
S07.  That is not too surprising, as Blanchette Brook enters Long Creek above 
Site S05. Conductivity in Long Creek climbs after snow events, and drops after
rain events that are significant enough to cause an increase in water depth in 
the stream.

## 2017 Storms at Site S03
```{r plot_site_S03_2017, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
focus_data <- s03_data %>%
  filter(Year == 2017 & DOY> 60 & DOY < 100) %>%
  select(sdate, DOY, SpCond_Median, D_Median, PRCP, SNOW, TMIN, TMAX) %>%
  rename(SpCond = SpCond_Median,
         Depth = D_Median)

plt <- time_plot(focus_data, sdate, SpCond, TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, SNOW, Depth,
                      .title = '2017 Storms at Site SO3') 
ggsave('figures/site_s03_2017.pdf', plot = plt, device = cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 6)
```

The pattern is a bit less clear at Site S03, especially following smaller 
storm events.  The rainfall on 3/06 and 3/07 leads to an increase in water depth,
but also an increase in conductivity. Conductivity then gradually declines over 
a period of days, until the major storm on 3/14, which appears to lead to 
increasing conductivity for a period of days. There is a one-day increase 
immediately after the small snow storm on 3/24, and then the rainfall on 
3/27 and 3/28 increases stream flow, and lowers conductivity.


## 2017 Storms at Site S01
```{r plot_site_S01_2017, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
focus_data <- s01_data %>%
  filter(Year == 2017 & DOY> 60 & DOY < 100) %>%
  select(sdate, DOY, SpCond_Median, D_Median, PRCP, SNOW, TMIN, TMAX) %>%
  rename(SpCond = SpCond_Median,
         Depth = D_Median)

plt <- time_plot(focus_data, sdate, SpCond, TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, SNOW, Depth,
                      .title = '2017 Storms at Site SO1') 
ggsave('figures/site_s01_2017.pdf', plot = plt, 
       device = cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 6)
```

We lack water depth data for this site in 2017. 

Rapidly climbing conductivity at the start of this period may be following a
minor rain event on 3/01 or warm daytime temperatures. The drop in Conductivity
on 3/05 and 3/06 does not correspond to any storm event.  The (warm)
precipitation on 3/07 and 3/08 occurs simultaneously with a spike in
conductivity, followed by a rapid drop.  Recovery to lower conductivity 3/10 to
3/17 appears to mirror temperatures, and occurs despite a snowstorm on 3/14.

The snow storm on 3/14 precedes a climb in specific conductance (moderate
compared to what was observed at the other sites) by several days. The
subsequent increase corresponds to warmer daytime temperatures.  Later rain 
events appear to have little effect on specific conductance in the stream.

Site S01 drains a sizeable portion of the parking area of the Maine Mall.  It's
watershed has a very high level of imperviousness, including many acres of
parking and roadway.  I hypothesize that the primary driver of high specific 
conductance at this site is wash-off of chlorides from the parking area
by liquid water during rain events and via snow melt on warm days.
